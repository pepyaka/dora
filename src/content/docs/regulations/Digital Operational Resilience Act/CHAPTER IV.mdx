#### General requirements for the performance of digital operational resilience testing 

1. For the purpose of assessing preparedness for handling ICT-related incidents, of identifying weaknesses, deficiencies  and gaps in digital operational resilience, and of promptly implementing corrective measures, financial entities, other than  microenterprises, shall, taking into account the criteria set out in Article 4(2), establish, maintain and review a sound and  comprehensive digital operational resilience testing programme as an integral part of the ICT risk-management framework  referred to in Article 6\. 

2. The digital operational resilience testing programme shall include a range of assessments, tests, methodologies,  practices and tools to be applied in accordance with Articles 25 and 26\. 

3. When conducting the digital operational resilience testing programme referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article,  financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall follow a risk-based approach taking into account the criteria set out in  Article 4(2) duly considering the evolving landscape of ICT risk, any specific risks to which the financial entity concerned is  or might be exposed, the criticality of information assets and of services provided, as well as any other factor the financial  entity deems appropriate. 

4. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall ensure that tests are undertaken by independent parties, whether  internal or external. Where tests are undertaken by an internal tester, financial entities shall dedicate sufficient resources and  ensure that conflicts of interest are avoided throughout the design and execution phases of the test. 

5. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall establish procedures and policies to prioritise, classify and  remedy all issues revealed throughout the performance of the tests and shall establish internal validation methodologies to  ascertain that all identified weaknesses, deficiencies or gaps are fully addressed. 

6. Financial entities, other than microenterprises, shall ensure, at least yearly, that appropriate tests are conducted on all  ICT systems and applications supporting critical or important functions. 


#### Testing of ICT tools and systems 

1. The digital operational resilience testing programme referred to in Article 24 shall provide, in accordance with the  criteria set out in Article 4(2), for the execution of appropriate tests, such as vulnerability assessments and scans, open  source analyses, network security assessments, gap analyses, physical security reviews, questionnaires and scanning  software solutions, source code reviews where feasible, scenario-based tests, compatibility testing, performance testing,  end-to-end testing and penetration testing. 

2. Central securities depositories and central counterparties shall perform vulnerability assessments before any  deployment or redeployment of new or existing applications and infrastructure components, and ICT services supporting  critical or important functions of the financial entity. 

3. Microenterprises shall perform the tests referred to in paragraph 1 by combining a risk-based approach with a  strategic planning of ICT testing, by duly considering the need to maintain a balanced approach between the scale of  resources and the time to be allocated to the ICT testing provided for in this Article, on the one hand, and the urgency,  type of risk, criticality of information assets and of services provided, as well as any other relevant factor, including the  financial entity’s ability to take calculated risks, on the other hand. 



#### Advanced testing of ICT tools, systems and processes based on TLPT

1. Financial entities, other than entities referred to in Article 16(1), first subparagraph, and other than microenterprises,  which are identified in accordance with paragraph 8, third subparagraph, of this Article, shall carry out at least every 3  years advanced testing by means of TLPT. Based on the risk profile of the financial entity and taking into account  operational circumstances, the competent authority may, where necessary, request the financial entity to reduce or  increase this frequency. 

2. Each threat-led penetration test shall cover several or all critical or important functions of a financial entity, and shall  be performed on live production systems supporting such functions. 

Financial entities shall identify all relevant underlying ICT systems, processes and technologies supporting critical or  important functions and ICT services, including those supporting the critical or important functions which have been  outsourced or contracted to ICT third-party service providers. 

Financial entities shall assess which critical or important functions need to be covered by the TLPT. The result of this  assessment shall determine the precise scope of TLPT and shall be validated by the competent authorities. 

3. Where ICT third-party service providers are included in the scope of TLPT, the financial entity shall take the necessary  measures and safeguards to ensure the participation of such ICT third-party service providers in the TLPT and shall retain at  all times full responsibility for ensuring compliance with this Regulation. 

4. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, first and second subparagraphs, where the participation of an ICT third-party  service provider in the TLPT, referred to in paragraph 3, is reasonably expected to have an adverse impact on the quality or  security of services delivered by the ICT third-party service provider to customers that are entities falling outside the scope  of this Regulation, or on the confidentiality of the data related to such services, the financial entity and the ICT third-party  service provider may agree in writing that the ICT third-party service provider directly enters into contractual arrangements  with an external tester, for the purpose of conducting, under the direction of one designated financial entity, a pooled TLPT  involving several financial entities (pooled testing) to which the ICT third-party service provider provides ICT services. 

That pooled testing shall cover the relevant range of ICT services supporting critical or important functions contracted to  the respective ICT third-party service provider by the financial entities. The pooled testing shall be considered TLPT carried  out by the financial entities participating in the pooled testing. 

The number of financial entities participating in the pooled testing shall be duly calibrated taking into account the  complexity and types of services involved. 

5. Financial entities shall, with the cooperation of ICT third-party service providers and other parties involved, including  the testers but excluding the competent authorities, apply effective risk management controls to mitigate the risks of any  potential impact on data, damage to assets, and disruption to critical or important functions, services or operations at the  financial entity itself, its counterparts or to the financial sector. 

6. At the end of the testing, after reports and remediation plans have been agreed, the financial entity and, where  applicable, the external testers shall provide to the authority, designated in accordance with paragraph 9 or 10, a summary  of the relevant findings, the remediation plans and the documentation demonstrating that the TLPT has been conducted in  accordance with the requirements. 

7. Authorities shall provide financial entities with an attestation confirming that the test was performed in accordance  with the requirements as evidenced in the documentation in order to allow for mutual recognition of threat led  penetration tests between competent authorities. The financial entity shall notify the relevant competent authority of the  attestation, the summary of the relevant findings and the remediation plans. 


Without prejudice to such attestation, financial entities shall remain at all times fully responsible for the impact of the tests  referred to in paragraph 4\. 

8. Financial entities shall contract testers for the purposes of undertaking TLPT in accordance with Article 27\. When  financial entities use internal testers for the purposes of undertaking TLPT, they shall contract external testers every three  tests. 

Credit institutions that are classified as significant in accordance with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, shall  only use external testers in accordance with Article 27(1), points (a) to (e). 

Competent authorities shall identify financial entities that are required to perform TLPT taking into account the criteria set  out in Article 4(2), based on an assessment of the following: 

    1. impact-related factors, in particular the extent to which the services provided and activities undertaken by the financial  entity impact the financial sector; 

    2. possible financial stability concerns, including the systemic character of the financial entity at Union or national level,  as applicable; 

    3. specific ICT risk profile, level of ICT maturity of the financial entity or technology features involved. 

9. Member States may designate a single public authority in the financial sector to be responsible for TLPT-related  matters in the financial sector at national level and shall entrust it with all competences and tasks to that effect. 

10. In the absence of a designation in accordance with paragraph 9 of this Article, and without prejudice to the power  to identify the financial entities that are required to perform TLPT, a competent authority may delegate the exercise of  some or all of the tasks referred to in this Article and Article 27 to another national authority in the financial sector. 

11. The ESAs shall, in agreement with the ECB, develop joint draft regulatory technical standards in accordance with the  TIBER-EU framework in order to specify further: 

    1. the criteria used for the purpose of the application of paragraph 8, second subparagraph; 

    2. the requirements and standards governing the use of internal testers; 

    3. the requirements in relation to: 

    9. the scope of TLPT referred to in paragraph 2; 

        2. the testing methodology and approach to be followed for each specific phase of the testing process; (iii) the results, closure and remediation stages of the testing; 

    4. the type of supervisory and other relevant cooperation which are needed for the implementation of TLPT, and for the  facilitation of mutual recognition of that testing, in the context of financial entities that operate in more than one  Member State, to allow an appropriate level of supervisory involvement and a flexible implementation to cater for  specificities of financial sub-sectors or local financial markets. 

When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall give due consideration to any specific feature  arising from the distinct nature of activities across different financial services sectors. 

The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 July 2024\. 

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards  referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU)  No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010. 



#### Requirements for testers for the carrying out of TLPT 

1. Financial entities shall only use testers for the carrying out of TLPT, that: 

    1. are of the highest suitability and reputability; 

    2. possess technical and organisational capabilities and demonstrate specific expertise in threat intelligence, penetration  testing and red team testing; 

    3. are certified by an accreditation body in a Member State or adhere to formal codes of conduct or ethical frameworks; 

    4. provide an independent assurance, or an audit report, in relation to the sound management of risks associated with the  carrying out of TLPT, including the due protection of the financial entity’s confidential information and redress for the  business risks of the financial entity; 

    5. are duly and fully covered by relevant professional indemnity insurances, including against risks of misconduct and  negligence. 

2. When using internal testers, financial entities shall ensure that, in addition to the requirements in paragraph 1, the  following conditions are met: 

    1. such use has been approved by the relevant competent authority or by the single public authority designated in  accordance with Article 26(9) and (10); 

    2. the relevant competent authority has verified that the financial entity has sufficient dedicated resources and ensured  that conflicts of interest are avoided throughout the design and execution phases of the test; and 

    3. the threat intelligence provider is external to the financial entity. 

3. Financial entities shall ensure that contracts concluded with external testers require a sound management of the TLPT  results and that any data processing thereof, including any generation, store, aggregation, draft, report, communication or  destruction, do not create risks to the financial entity.
