#### ICT-related incident management process

1. Financial entities shall define, establish and implement an ICT-related incident management process to detect, manage  and notify ICT-related incidents. 

2. Financial entities shall record all ICT-related incidents and significant cyber threats. Financial entities shall establish  appropriate procedures and processes to ensure a consistent and integrated monitoring, handling and follow-up of ICT related incidents, to ensure that root causes are identified, documented and addressed in order to prevent the occurrence of  such incidents. 


3. The ICT-related incident management process referred to in paragraph 1 shall: 

    1. put in place early warning indicators; 

    2. establish procedures to identify, track, log, categorise and classify ICT-related incidents according to their priority and  severity and according to the criticality of the services impacted, in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 18(1); 

    3. assign roles and responsibilities that need to be activated for different ICT-related incident types and scenarios; 

    4. set out plans for communication to staff, external stakeholders and media in accordance with Article 14 and for  notification to clients, for internal escalation procedures, including ICT-related customer complaints, as well as for the  provision of information to financial entities that act as counterparts, as appropriate; 

    5. ensure that at least major ICT-related incidents are reported to relevant senior management and inform the  management body of at least major ICT-related incidents, explaining the impact, response and additional controls to  be established as a result of such ICT-related incidents; 

    6. establish ICT-related incident response procedures to mitigate impacts and ensure that services become operational and  secure in a timely manner. 

<Article number="18" />

#### Classification of ICT-related incidents and cyber threats 

1. Financial entities shall classify ICT-related incidents and shall determine their impact based on the following criteria: 

    1. the number and/or relevance of clients or financial counterparts affected and, where applicable, the amount or number  of transactions affected by the ICT-related incident, and whether the ICT-related incident has caused reputational  impact; 

    2. the duration of the ICT-related incident, including the service downtime; 

    3. the geographical spread with regard to the areas affected by the ICT-related incident, particularly if it affects more than  two Member States; 

    4. the data losses that the ICT-related incident entails, in relation to availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of  data; 

    5. the criticality of the services affected, including the financial entity’s transactions and operations; 

    6. the economic impact, in particular direct and indirect costs and losses, of the ICT-related incident in both absolute and  relative terms. 

2. Financial entities shall classify cyber threats as significant based on the criticality of the services at risk, including the  financial entity’s transactions and operations, number and/or relevance of clients or financial counterparts targeted and the  geographical spread of the areas at risk. 

3. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee and in consultation with the ECB and ENISA, develop common draft  regulatory technical standards further specifying the following: 

    1. the criteria set out in paragraph 1, including materiality thresholds for determining major ICT-related incidents or, as  applicable, major operational or security payment-related incidents, that are subject to the reporting obligation laid  down in Article 19(1); 

    2. the criteria to be applied by competent authorities for the purpose of assessing the relevance of major ICT-related  incidents or, as applicable, major operational or security payment-related incidents, to relevant competent authorities  in other Member States’, and the details of reports of major ICT-related incidents or, as applicable, major operational  or security payment-related incidents, to be shared with other competent authorities pursuant to Article 19(6) and (7); 

    3. the criteria set out in paragraph 2 of this Article, including high materiality thresholds for determining significant cyber  threats. 


4. When developing the common draft regulatory technical standards referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, the  ESAs shall take into account the criteria set out in Article 4(2), as well as international standards, guidance and  specifications developed and published by ENISA, including, where appropriate, specifications for other economic sectors.  For the purposes of applying the criteria set out in Article 4(2), the ESAs shall duly consider the need for microenterprises  and small and medium-sized enterprises to mobilise sufficient resources and capabilities to ensure that ICT-related incidents  are managed swiftly. 

The ESAs shall submit those common draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 January 2024\. 

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards  referred to in paragraph 3 in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010  and (EU) No 1095/2010. 

<Article number="19" />

#### Reporting of major ICT-related incidents and voluntary notification of significant cyber threats 

1. Financial entities shall report major ICT-related incidents to the relevant competent authority as referred to in  Article 46 in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article. 

Where a financial entity is subject to supervision by more than one national competent authority referred to in Article 46,  Member States shall designate a single competent authority as the relevant competent authority responsible for carrying out  the functions and duties provided for in this Article. 

Credit institutions classified as significant, in accordance with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, shall report  major ICT-related incidents to the relevant national competent authority designated in accordance with Article 4 of  Directive 2013/36/EU, which shall immediately transmit that report to the ECB. 

For the purpose of the first subparagraph, financial entities shall produce, after collecting and analysing all relevant  information, the initial notification and reports referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article using the templates referred to in  Article 20 and submit them to the competent authority. In the event that a technical impossibility prevents the submission  of the initial notification using the template, financial entities shall notify the competent authority about it via alternative  means. 

The initial notification and reports referred to in paragraph 4 shall include all information necessary for the competent  authority to determine the significance of the major ICT-related incident and assess possible cross-border impacts. 

Without prejudice to the reporting pursuant to the first subparagraph by the financial entity to the relevant competent  authority, Member States may additionally determine that some or all financial entities shall also provide the initial  notification and each report referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article using the templates referred to in Article 20 to the  competent authorities or the computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) designated or established in accordance  with Directive (EU) 2022/2555. 

2. Financial entities may, on a voluntary basis, notify significant cyber threats to the relevant competent authority when  they deem the threat to be of relevance to the financial system, service users or clients. The relevant competent authority  may provide such information to other relevant authorities referred to in paragraph 6\. 

Credit institutions classified as significant, in accordance with Article 6(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, may, on a  voluntary basis, notify significant cyber threats to relevant national competent authority, designated in accordance with  Article 4 of Directive 2013/36/EU, which shall immediately transmit the notification to the ECB. 

Member States may determine that those financial entities that on a voluntary basis notify in accordance with the first  subparagraph may also transmit that notification to the CSIRTs designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU)  2022/2555. 


3. Where a major ICT-related incident occurs and has an impact on the financial interests of clients, financial entities  shall, without undue delay as soon as they become aware of it, inform their clients about the major ICT-related incident  and about the measures that have been taken to mitigate the adverse effects of such incident. 

In the case of a significant cyber threat, financial entities shall, where applicable, inform their clients that are potentially  affected of any appropriate protection measures which the latter may consider taking. 

4. Financial entities shall, within the time limits to be laid down in accordance with Article 20, first paragraph, point (a),  point (ii), submit the following to the relevant competent authority: 

    1. an initial notification; 

    2. an intermediate report after the initial notification referred to in point (a), as soon as the status of the original incident  has changed significantly or the handling of the major ICT-related incident has changed based on new information  available, followed, as appropriate, by updated notifications every time a relevant status update is available, as well as  upon a specific request of the competent authority; 

    3. a final report, when the root cause analysis has been completed, regardless of whether mitigation measures have  already been implemented, and when the actual impact figures are available to replace estimates. 

5. Financial entities may outsource, in accordance with Union and national sectoral law, the reporting obligations under  this Article to a third-party service provider. In case of such outsourcing, the financial entity remains fully responsible for  the fulfilment of the incident reporting requirements. 

6. Upon receipt of the initial notification and of each report referred to in paragraph 4, the competent authority shall, in  a timely manner, provide details of the major ICT-related incident to the following recipients based, as applicable, on their  respective competences: 

    1. EBA, ESMA or EIOPA; 

    2. the ECB, in the case of financial entities referred to in Article 2(1), points (a), (b) and (d); 

    3. the competent authorities, single points of contact or CSIRTs designated or established in accordance with Directive  (EU) 2022/2555; 

    4. the resolution authorities, as referred to in Article 3 of Directive 2014/59/EU, and the Single Resolution Board (SRB)  with respect to entities referred to in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of  the Council (37), and with respect to entities and groups referred to in Article 7(4)(b) and (5) of Regulation (EU)  No 806/2014 if such details concern incidents that pose a risk to ensuring critical functions within the meaning of  Article 2(1), point (35), of Directive 2014/59/EU; and 

    5. other relevant public authorities under national law. 

7. Following receipt of information in accordance with paragraph 6, EBA, ESMA or EIOPA and the ECB, in consultation  with ENISA and in cooperation with the relevant competent authority, shall assess whether the major ICT-related incident is  relevant for competent authorities in other Member States. Following that assessment, EBA, ESMA or EIOPA shall, as soon  as possible, notify relevant competent authorities in other Member States accordingly. The ECB shall notify the members of  the European System of Central Banks on issues relevant to the payment system. Based on that notification, the competent  authorities shall, where appropriate, take all of the necessary measures to protect the immediate stability of the financial  system. 

8. The notification to be done by ESMA pursuant to paragraph 7 of this Article shall be without prejudice to the  responsibility of the competent authority to urgently transmit the details of the major ICT-related incident to the relevant  authority in the host Member State, where a central securities depository has significant cross-border activity in the host  Member State, the major ICT-related incident is likely to have severe consequences for the financial markets of the host  Member State and where there are cooperation arrangements among competent authorities related to the supervision of  financial entities. 

<Article number="20" />

#### Harmonisation of reporting content and templates 

The ESAs, through the Joint Committee, and in consultation with ENISA and the ECB, shall develop: 

    1. common draft regulatory technical standards in order to: 

    9. establish the content of the reports for major ICT-related incidents in order to reflect the criteria laid down in  Article 18(1) and incorporate further elements, such as details for establishing the relevance of the reporting for  other Member States and whether it constitutes a major operational or security payment-related incident or not; 

        2. determine the time limits for the initial notification and for each report referred to in Article 19(4); (iii) establish the content of the notification for significant cyber threats. 

When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall take into account the size and the overall  risk profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and operations, and in  particular, with a view to ensuring that, for the purposes of this paragraph, point (a), point (ii), different time limits  may reflect, as appropriate, specificities of financial sectors, without prejudice to maintaining a consistent approach to  ICT-related incident reporting pursuant to this Regulation and to Directive (EU) 2022/2555. The ESAs shall, as  applicable, provide justification when deviating from the approaches taken in the context of that Directive; 

    2. common draft implementing technical standards in order to establish the standard forms, templates and procedures for  financial entities to report a major ICT-related incident and to notify a significant cyber threat. 

The ESAs shall submit the common draft regulatory technical standards referred to in the first paragraph, point (a), and the  common draft implementing technical standards referred to in the first paragraph, point (b), to the Commission by 17 July  2024\. 

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the common regulatory technical  standards referred to in the first paragraph, point (a), in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU)  No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010. 

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the common implementing technical standards referred to in the first  paragraph, point (b), in accordance with Article 15 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU)  No 1095/2010. 

<Article number="21" />

#### Centralisation of reporting of major ICT-related incidents 

1. The ESAs, through the Joint Committee, and in consultation with the ECB and ENISA, shall prepare a joint report  assessing the feasibility of further centralisation of incident reporting through the establishment of a single EU Hub for  major ICT-related incident reporting by financial entities. The joint report shall explore ways to facilitate the flow of ICT related incident reporting, reduce associated costs and underpin thematic analyses with a view to enhancing supervisory  convergence. 


2. The joint report referred to in paragraph 1 shall comprise at least the following elements: 

    1. prerequisites for the establishment of a single EU Hub; 

    2. benefits, limitations and risks, including risks associated with the high concentration of sensitive information; (c) the necessary capability to ensure interoperability with regard to other relevant reporting schemes; 

    4. elements of operational management; 

    5. conditions of membership; 

    6. technical arrangements for financial entities and national competent authorities to access the single EU Hub; 

    7. a preliminary assessment of financial costs incurred by setting-up the operational platform supporting the single EU  Hub, including the requisite expertise. 

3. The ESAs shall submit the report referred to in paragraph 1 to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the  Commission by 17 January 2025\. 

<Article number="22" />

#### Supervisory feedback 

1. Without prejudice to the technical input, advice or remedies and subsequent follow-up which may be provided,  where applicable, in accordance with national law, by the CSIRTs under Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the competent  authority shall, upon receipt of the initial notification and of each report as referred to in Article 19(4), acknowledge  receipt and may, where feasible, provide in a timely manner relevant and proportionate feedback or high-level guidance to  the financial entity, in particular by making available any relevant anonymised information and intelligence on similar  threats, and may discuss remedies applied at the level of the financial entity and ways to minimise and mitigate adverse  impact across the financial sector. Without prejudice to the supervisory feedback received, financial entities shall remain  fully responsible for the handling and for consequences of the ICT-related incidents reported pursuant to Article 19(1). 

2. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, on an anonymised and aggregated basis, report yearly on major ICT related incidents, the details of which shall be provided by competent authorities in accordance with Article 19(6), setting  out at least the number of major ICT-related incidents, their nature and their impact on the operations of financial entities  or clients, remedial actions taken and costs incurred. 

The ESAs shall issue warnings and produce high-level statistics to support ICT threat and vulnerability assessments. 

<Article number="23" />

#### Operational or security payment-related incidents concerning credit institutions, payment institutions, account  information service providers, and electronic money institutions 

The requirements laid down in this Chapter shall also apply to operational or security payment-related incidents and to  major operational or security payment-related incidents, where they concern credit institutions, payment institutions,  account information service providers, and electronic money institutions.
