For the purposes of the first subparagraph of this point, the review shall include an analysis of the regime referred to in  Article 31(12), including in terms of access for Union financial entities to services from third countries and availability  of such services on the Union market and it shall take into account further developments in the markets for the services  covered by this Regulation, the practical experience of financial entities and financial supervisors with regard to the  application and, respectively, supervision of that regime, and any relevant regulatory and supervisory developments  taking place at international level.

In the context of the review of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, the Commission shall assess the need for increased cyber  resilience of payment systems and payment-processing activities and the appropriateness of extending the scope of this  Regulation to operators of payment systems and entities involved in payment-processing activities. In light of this  assessment, the Commission shall submit, as part of the review of Directive (EU) 2015/2366, a report to the European  Parliament and the Council no later than 17 July 2023\. 

Based on that review report, and after consulting ESAs, ECB and the ESRB, the Commission may submit, where appropriate  and as part of the legislative proposal that it may adopt pursuant to Article 108, second paragraph, of Directive (EU)  2015/2366, a proposal to ensure that all operators of payment systems and entities involved in payment-processing  activities are subject to an appropriate oversight, while taking into account existing oversight by the central bank.
