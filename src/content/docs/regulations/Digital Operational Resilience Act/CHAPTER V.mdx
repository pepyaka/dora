### Key principles for a sound management of ICT third-party risk

<Article number="28" />

#### General principles

1. Financial entities shall manage ICT third-party risk as an integral component of ICT risk within their ICT risk  management framework as referred to in Article 6(1), and in accordance with the following principles: 

    1. financial entities that have in place contractual arrangements for the use of ICT services to run their business operations  shall, at all times, remain fully responsible for compliance with, and the discharge of, all obligations under this  Regulation and applicable financial services law; 


    2. financial entities’ management of ICT third-party risk shall be implemented in light of the principle of proportionality,  taking into account: 

    9. the nature, scale, complexity and importance of ICT-related dependencies, 

        2. the risks arising from contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services concluded with ICT third-party service  providers, taking into account the criticality or importance of the respective service, process or function, and the  potential impact on the continuity and availability of financial services and activities, at individual and at group  level. 

2. As part of their ICT risk management framework, financial entities, other than entities referred to in Article 16(1),  first subparagraph, and other than microenterprises, shall adopt, and regularly review, a strategy on ICT third-party risk,  taking into account the multi-vendor strategy referred to in Article 6(9), where applicable. The strategy on ICT third-party  risk shall include a policy on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions provided by ICT third-party  service providers and shall apply on an individual basis and, where relevant, on a sub-consolidated and consolidated basis.  The management body shall, on the basis of an assessment of the overall risk profile of the financial entity and the scale  and complexity of the business services, regularly review the risks identified in respect to contractual arrangements on the  use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions. 

3. As part of their ICT risk management framework, financial entities shall maintain and update at entity level, and at  sub-consolidated and consolidated levels, a register of information in relation to all contractual arrangements on the use of  ICT services provided by ICT third-party service providers. 

The contractual arrangements referred to in the first subparagraph shall be appropriately documented, distinguishing  between those that cover ICT services supporting critical or important functions and those that do not. 

Financial entities shall report at least yearly to the competent authorities on the number of new arrangements on the use of  ICT services, the categories of ICT third-party service providers, the type of contractual arrangements and the ICT services  and functions which are being provided. 

Financial entities shall make available to the competent authority, upon its request, the full register of information or, as  requested, specified sections thereof, along with any information deemed necessary to enable the effective supervision of  the financial entity. 

Financial entities shall inform the competent authority in a timely manner about any planned contractual arrangement on  the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions as well as when a function has become critical or  important. 

4. Before entering into a contractual arrangement on the use of ICT services, financial entities shall: 

    1. assess whether the contractual arrangement covers the use of ICT services supporting a critical or important function; (b) assess if supervisory conditions for contracting are met; 

    3. identify and assess all relevant risks in relation to the contractual arrangement, including the possibility that such  contractual arrangement may contribute to reinforcing ICT concentration risk as referred to in Article 29; 

    4. undertake all due diligence on prospective ICT third-party service providers and ensure throughout the selection and  assessment processes that the ICT third-party service provider is suitable; 

    5. identify and assess conflicts of interest that the contractual arrangement may cause. 

5. Financial entities may only enter into contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service providers that comply  with appropriate information security standards. When those contractual arrangements concern critical or important  functions, financial entities shall, prior to concluding the arrangements, take due consideration of the use, by ICT third party service providers, of the most up-to-date and highest quality information security standards. 


6. In exercising access, inspection and audit rights over the ICT third-party service provider, financial entities shall, on  the basis of a risk-based approach, pre-determine the frequency of audits and inspections as well as the areas to be audited  through adhering to commonly accepted audit standards in line with any supervisory instruction on the use and  incorporation of such audit standards. 

Where contractual arrangements concluded with ICT third-party service providers on the use of ICT services entail high  technical complexity, the financial entity shall verify that auditors, whether internal or external, or a pool of auditors,  possess appropriate skills and knowledge to effectively perform the relevant audits and assessments. 

7. Financial entities shall ensure that contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services may be terminated in any of  the following circumstances: 

    1. significant breach by the ICT third-party service provider of applicable laws, regulations or contractual terms; 

    2. circumstances identified throughout the monitoring of ICT third-party risk that are deemed capable of altering the  performance of the functions provided through the contractual arrangement, including material changes that affect  the arrangement or the situation of the ICT third-party service provider; 

    3. ICT third-party service provider’s evidenced weaknesses pertaining to its overall ICT risk management and in particular  in the way it ensures the availability, authenticity, integrity and, confidentiality, of data, whether personal or otherwise  sensitive data, or non-personal data; 

    4. where the competent authority can no longer effectively supervise the financial entity as a result of the conditions of, or  circumstances related to, the respective contractual arrangement. 

8. For ICT services supporting critical or important functions, financial entities shall put in place exit strategies. The exit  strategies shall take into account risks that may emerge at the level of ICT third-party service providers, in particular a  possible failure on their part, a deterioration of the quality of the ICT services provided, any business disruption due to  inappropriate or failed provision of ICT services or any material risk arising in relation to the appropriate and continuous  deployment of the respective ICT service, or the termination of contractual arrangements with ICT third-party service  providers under any of the circumstances listed in paragraph 7\. 

Financial entities shall ensure that they are able to exit contractual arrangements without: 

    1. disruption to their business activities, 

    2. limiting compliance with regulatory requirements, 

    3. detriment to the continuity and quality of services provided to clients. 

Exit plans shall be comprehensive, documented and, in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 4(2), shall be  sufficiently tested and reviewed periodically. 

Financial entities shall identify alternative solutions and develop transition plans enabling them to remove the contracted  ICT services and the relevant data from the ICT third-party service provider and to securely and integrally transfer them to  alternative providers or reincorporate them in-house. 

Financial entities shall have appropriate contingency measures in place to maintain business continuity in the event of the  circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph. 

9. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft implementing technical standards to establish the  standard templates for the purposes of the register of information referred to in paragraph 3, including information that is  common to all contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services. The ESAs shall submit those draft implementing  technical standards to the Commission by 17 January 2024\. 

Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph  in accordance with Article 15 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010. 


10. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the  detailed content of the policy referred to in paragraph 2 in relation to the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT  services supporting critical or important functions provided by ICT third-party service providers. 

When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall take into account the size and the overall risk  profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and operations. The ESAs shall  submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 January 2024\. 

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards  referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU)  No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010. 

<Article number="29" />

#### Preliminary assessment of ICT concentration risk at entity level

1. When performing the identification and assessment of risks referred to in Article 28(4), point (c), financial entities  shall also take into account whether the envisaged conclusion of a contractual arrangement in relation to ICT services  supporting critical or important functions would lead to any of the following: 

    1. contracting an ICT third-party service provider that is not easily substitutable; or 

    2. having in place multiple contractual arrangements in relation to the provision of ICT services supporting critical or  important functions with the same ICT third-party service provider or with closely connected ICT third-party service  providers. 

Financial entities shall weigh the benefits and costs of alternative solutions, such as the use of different ICT third-party  service providers, taking into account if and how envisaged solutions match the business needs and objectives set out in  their digital resilience strategy. 

2. Where the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions include the  possibility that an ICT third-party service provider further subcontracts ICT services supporting a critical or important  function to other ICT third-party service providers, financial entities shall weigh benefits and risks that may arise in  connection with such subcontracting, in particular in the case of an ICT subcontractor established in a third-country. 

Where contractual arrangements concern ICT services supporting critical or important functions, financial entities shall  duly consider the insolvency law provisions that would apply in the event of the ICT third-party service provider’s  bankruptcy as well as any constraint that may arise in respect to the urgent recovery of the financial entity’s data. 

Where contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions are concluded with  an ICT third-party service provider established in a third country, financial entities shall, in addition to the considerations  referred to in the second subparagraph, also consider the compliance with Union data protection rules and the effective  enforcement of the law in that third country. 

Where the contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions provide for  subcontracting, financial entities shall assess whether and how potentially long or complex chains of subcontracting may  impact their ability to fully monitor the contracted functions and the ability of the competent authority to effectively  supervise the financial entity in that respect. 


<Article number="30" />

#### Key contractual provisions

1. The rights and obligations of the financial entity and of the ICT third-party service provider shall be clearly allocated  and set out in writing. The full contract shall include the service level agreements and be documented in one written  document which shall be available to the parties on paper, or in a document with another downloadable, durable and  accessible format. 

2. The contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services shall include at least the following elements: 

    1. a clear and complete description of all functions and ICT services to be provided by the ICT third-party service provider,  indicating whether subcontracting of an ICT service supporting a critical or important function, or material parts  thereof, is permitted and, when that is the case, the conditions applying to such subcontracting; 

    2. the locations, namely the regions or countries, where the contracted or subcontracted functions and ICT services are to  be provided and where data is to be processed, including the storage location, and the requirement for the ICT third party service provider to notify the financial entity in advance if it envisages changing such locations; 

    3. provisions on availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality in relation to the protection of data, including  personal data; 

    4. provisions on ensuring access, recovery and return in an easily accessible format of personal and non-personal data  processed by the financial entity in the event of the insolvency, resolution or discontinuation of the business  operations of the ICT third-party service provider, or in the event of the termination of the contractual arrangements; 

    5. service level descriptions, including updates and revisions thereof; 

    6. the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to provide assistance to the financial entity at no additional cost,  or at a cost that is determined ex-ante, when an ICT incident that is related to the ICT service provided to the financial  entity occurs; 

    7. the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to fully cooperate with the competent authorities and the  resolution authorities of the financial entity, including persons appointed by them; 

    8. termination rights and related minimum notice periods for the termination of the contractual arrangements, in  accordance with the expectations of competent authorities and resolution authorities; 

    9. the conditions for the participation of ICT third-party service providers in the financial entities’ ICT security awareness  programmes and digital operational resilience training in accordance with Article 13(6). 

3. The contractual arrangements on the use of ICT services supporting critical or important functions shall include, in  addition to the elements referred to in paragraph 2, at least the following: 

    1. full service level descriptions, including updates and revisions thereof with precise quantitative and qualitative  performance targets within the agreed service levels to allow effective monitoring by the financial entity of ICT services  and enable appropriate corrective actions to be taken, without undue delay, when agreed service levels are not met; 

    2. notice periods and reporting obligations of the ICT third-party service provider to the financial entity, including  notification of any development that might have a material impact on the ICT third-party service provider’s ability to  effectively provide the ICT services supporting critical or important functions in line with agreed service levels; 

    3. requirements for the ICT third-party service provider to implement and test business contingency plans and to have in  place ICT security measures, tools and policies that provide an appropriate level of security for the provision of services  by the financial entity in line with its regulatory framework; 

    4. the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to participate and fully cooperate in the financial entity’s TLPT as  referred to in Articles 26 and 27; 

    5. the right to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the ICT third-party service provider’s performance, which entails the  following: 


    9. unrestricted rights of access, inspection and audit by the financial entity, or an appointed third party, and by the  competent authority, and the right to take copies of relevant documentation on-site if they are critical to the  operations of the ICT third-party service provider, the effective exercise of which is not impeded or limited by  other contractual arrangements or implementation policies; 

        2. the right to agree on alternative assurance levels if other clients’ rights are affected; 

        3. the obligation of the ICT third-party service provider to fully cooperate during the onsite inspections and audits  performed by the competent authorities, the Lead Overseer, financial entity or an appointed third party; and 

        4. the obligation to provide details on the scope, procedures to be followed and frequency of such inspections and  audits; 

    6. exit strategies, in particular the establishment of a mandatory adequate transition period: 

    9. during which the ICT third-party service provider will continue providing the respective functions, or ICT services,  with a view to reducing the risk of disruption at the financial entity or to ensure its effective resolution and  restructuring; 

        2. allowing the financial entity to migrate to another ICT third-party service provider or change to in-house solutions  consistent with the complexity of the service provided. 

By way of derogation from point (e), the ICT third-party service provider and the financial entity that is a microenterprise  may agree that the financial entity’s rights of access, inspection and audit can be delegated to an independent third party,  appointed by the ICT third-party service provider, and that the financial entity is able to request information and assurance  on the ICT third-party service provider’s performance from the third party at any time. 

4. When negotiating contractual arrangements, financial entities and ICT third-party service providers shall consider the  use of standard contractual clauses developed by public authorities for specific services. 

5. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further the  elements referred to in paragraph 2, point (a), which a financial entity needs to determine and assess when subcontracting  ICT services supporting critical or important functions. 

When developing those draft regulatory technical standards, the ESAs shall take into consideration the size and overall risk  profile of the financial entity, and the nature, scale and complexity of its services, activities and operations. 

The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 July 2024\. 

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards  referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU)  No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010. 

<Section number="2" />

### Oversight Framework of critical ICT third-party service providers

<Article number="31" />

#### Designation of critical ICT third-party service providers

1. The ESAs, through the Joint Committee and upon recommendation from the Oversight Forum established pursuant  to Article 32(1), shall: 

    1. designate the ICT third-party service providers that are critical for financial entities, following an assessment that takes  into account the criteria specified in paragraph 2; 


    2. appoint as Lead Overseer for each critical ICT third-party service provider the ESA that is responsible, in accordance  with Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 or (EU) No 1095/2010, for the financial entities having  together the largest share of total assets out of the value of total assets of all financial entities using the services of the  relevant critical ICT third-party service provider, as evidenced by the sum of the individual balance sheets of those  financial entities. 

2. The designation referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall be based on all of the following criteria in relation to ICT  services provided by the ICT third-party service provider: 

    1. the systemic impact on the stability, continuity or quality of the provision of financial services in the event that the  relevant ICT third-party service provider would face a large scale operational failure to provide its services, taking into  account the number of financial entities and the total value of assets of financial entities to which the relevant ICT  third-party service provider provides services; 

    2. the systemic character or importance of the financial entities that rely on the relevant ICT third-party service provider,  assessed in accordance with the following parameters: 

    9. the number of global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) or other systemically important institutions  (O-SIIs) that rely on the respective ICT third-party service provider; 

        2. the interdependence between the G-SIIs or O-SIIs referred to in point (i) and other financial entities, including  situations where the G-SIIs or O-SIIs provide financial infrastructure services to other financial entities; 

    3. the reliance of financial entities on the services provided by the relevant ICT third-party service provider in relation to  critical or important functions of financial entities that ultimately involve the same ICT third-party service provider,  irrespective of whether financial entities rely on those services directly or indirectly, through subcontracting  arrangements; 

    4. the degree of substitutability of the ICT third-party service provider, taking into account the following parameters: 

    9. the lack of real alternatives, even partial, due to the limited number of ICT third-party service providers active on a  specific market, or the market share of the relevant ICT third-party service provider, or the technical complexity or  sophistication involved, including in relation to any proprietary technology, or the specific features of the ICT  third-party service provider’s organisation or activity; 

        2. difficulties in relation to partially or fully migrating the relevant data and workloads from the relevant ICT third party service provider to another ICT third-party service provider, due either to significant financial costs, time or  other resources that the migration process may entail, or to increased ICT risk or other operational risks to which  the financial entity may be exposed through such migration. 

3. Where the ICT third-party service provider belongs to a group, the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 shall be  considered in relation to the ICT services provided by the group as a whole. 

4. Critical ICT third-party service providers which are part of a group shall designate one legal person as a coordination  point to ensure adequate representation and communication with the Lead Overseer. 

5. The Lead Overseer shall notify the ICT third-party service provider of the outcome of the assessment leading to the  designation referred in paragraph 1, point (a). Within 6 weeks from the date of the notification, the ICT third-party service  provider may submit to the Lead Overseer a reasoned statement with any relevant information for the purposes of the  assessment. The Lead Overseer shall consider the reasoned statement and may request additional information to be  submitted within 30 calendar days of the receipt of such statement. 


After designating an ICT third-party service provider as critical, the ESAs, through the Joint Committee, shall notify the ICT  third-party service provider of such designation and the starting date as from which they will effectively be subject to  oversight activities. That starting date shall be no later than one month after the notification. The ICT third-party service  provider shall notify the financial entities to which they provide services of their designation as critical. 

6. The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 57 to supplement this Regulation  by specifying further the criteria referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, by 17 July 2024\. 

7. The designation referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall not be used until the Commission has adopted a delegated  act in accordance with paragraph 6\. 

8. The designation referred to in paragraph 1, point (a), shall not apply to the following: 

    9. financial entities providing ICT services to other financial entities; 

        2. ICT third-party service providers that are subject to oversight frameworks established for the purposes of supporting  the tasks referred to in Article 127(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; 

        3. ICT intra-group service providers; 

        4. ICT third-party service providers providing ICT services solely in one Member State to financial entities that are only  active in that Member State. 

9. The ESAs, through the Joint Committee, shall establish, publish and update yearly the list of critical ICT third-party  service providers at Union level. 

10. For the purposes of paragraph 1, point (a), competent authorities shall, on a yearly and aggregated basis, transmit  the reports referred to in Article 28(3), third subparagraph, to the Oversight Forum established pursuant to Article 32\. The  Oversight Forum shall assess the ICT third-party dependencies of financial entities based on the information received from  the competent authorities. 

11. The ICT third-party service providers that are not included in the list referred to in paragraph 9 may request to be  designated as critical in accordance with paragraph 1, point (a). 

For the purpose of the first subparagraph, the ICT third-party service provider shall submit a reasoned application to EBA,  ESMA or EIOPA, which, through the Joint Committee, shall decide whether to designate that ICT third-party service  provider as critical in accordance with paragraph 1, point (a). 

The decision referred to in the second subparagraph shall be adopted and notified to the ICT third-party service provider  within 6 months of receipt of the application. 

12. Financial entities shall only make use of the services of an ICT third-party service provider established in a third  country and which has been designated as critical in accordance with paragraph 1, point (a), if the latter has established a  subsidiary in the Union within the 12 months following the designation. 

13. The critical ICT third-party service provider referred to in paragraph 12 shall notify the Lead Overseer of any  changes to the structure of the management of the subsidiary established in the Union. 

<Article number="32" />

#### Structure of the Oversight Framework

1. The Joint Committee, in accordance with Article 57(1) of Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and  (EU) No 1095/2010, shall establish the Oversight Forum as a sub-committee for the purposes of supporting the work of  the Joint Committee and of the Lead Overseer referred to in Article 31(1), point (b), in the area of ICT third-party risk  across financial sectors. The Oversight Forum shall prepare the draft joint positions and the draft common acts of the Joint  Committee in that area. 


The Oversight Forum shall regularly discuss relevant developments on ICT risk and vulnerabilities and promote a consistent  approach in the monitoring of ICT third-party risk at Union level. 

2. The Oversight Forum shall, on a yearly basis, undertake a collective assessment of the results and findings of the  oversight activities conducted for all critical ICT third-party service providers and promote coordination measures to  increase the digital operational resilience of financial entities, foster best practices on addressing ICT concentration risk and  explore mitigants for cross-sector risk transfers. 

3. The Oversight Forum shall submit comprehensive benchmarks for critical ICT third-party service providers to be  adopted by the Joint Committee as joint positions of the ESAs in accordance with Article 56(1) of Regulations (EU)  No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010.

<Article number="33" />

#### Tasks of the Lead Overseer

1. The Lead Overseer, appointed in accordance with Article 31(1), point (b), shall conduct the oversight of the assigned  critical ICT third-party service providers and shall be, for the purposes of all matters related to the oversight, the primary  point of contact for those critical ICT third-party service providers. 

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Lead Overseer shall assess whether each critical ICT third-party service provider  has in place comprehensive, sound and effective rules, procedures, mechanisms and arrangements to manage the ICT risk  which it may pose to financial entities. 

The assessment referred to in the first subparagraph shall focus mainly on ICT services provided by the critical ICT third party service provider supporting the critical or important functions of financial entities. Where necessary to address all  relevant risks, that assessment shall extend to ICT services supporting functions other than those that are critical or  important. 

3. The assessment referred to in paragraph 2 shall cover: 

    1. ICT requirements to ensure, in particular, the security, availability, continuity, scalability and quality of services which  the critical ICT third-party service provider provides to financial entities, as well as the ability to maintain at all times  high standards of availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of data; 

    2. the physical security contributing to ensuring the ICT security, including the security of premises, facilities, data centres; 

    3. the risk management processes, including ICT risk management policies, ICT business continuity policy and ICT  response and recovery plans; 

    4. the governance arrangements, including an organisational structure with clear, transparent and consistent lines of  responsibility and accountability rules enabling effective ICT risk management; 

    5. the identification, monitoring and prompt reporting of material ICT-related incidents to financial entities, the  management and resolution of those incidents, in particular cyber-attacks; 

    6. the mechanisms for data portability, application portability and interoperability, which ensure an effective exercise of  termination rights by the financial entities; 

    7. the testing of ICT systems, infrastructure and controls; 

    8. the ICT audits; 

    9. the use of relevant national and international standards applicable to the provision of its ICT services to the financial  entities. 

4. Based on the assessment referred to in paragraph 2, and in coordination with the Joint Oversight Network (JON)  referred to in Article 34(1), the Lead Overseer shall adopt a clear, detailed and reasoned individual oversight plan  describing the annual oversight objectives and the main oversight actions planned for each critical ICT third-party service  provider. That plan shall be communicated yearly to the critical ICT third-party service provider. 

Prior to the adoption of the oversight plan, the Lead Overseer shall communicate the draft oversight plan to the critical ICT  third-party service provider. 

Upon receipt of the draft oversight plan, the critical ICT third-party service provider may submit a reasoned statement  within 15 calendar days evidencing the expected impact on customers which are entities falling outside of the scope of this  Regulation and where appropriate, formulating solutions to mitigate risks. 

5. Once the annual oversight plans referred to in paragraph 4 have been adopted and notified to the critical ICT third party service providers, competent authorities may take measures concerning such critical ICT third-party service  providers only in agreement with the Lead Overseer. 


<Article number="34" />

#### Operational coordination between Lead Overseers

1. To ensure a consistent approach to oversight activities and with a view to enabling coordinated general oversight  strategies and cohesive operational approaches and work methodologies, the three Lead Overseers appointed in  accordance with Article 31(1), point (b), shall set up a JON to coordinate among themselves in the preparatory stages and  to coordinate the conduct of oversight activities over their respective overseen critical ICT third-party service providers, as  well as in the course of any action that may be needed pursuant to Article 42\. 

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the Lead Overseers shall draw up a common oversight protocol specifying the  detailed procedures to be followed for carrying out the day-to-day coordination and for ensuring swift exchanges and  reactions. The protocol shall be periodically revised to reflect operational needs, in particular the evolution of practical  oversight arrangements. 

3. The Lead Overseers may, on an ad-hoc basis, call on the ECB and ENISA to provide technical advice, share hands-on  experience or join specific coordination meetings of the JON. 

<Article number="35" />

#### Powers of the Lead Overseer

1. For the purposes of carrying out the duties laid down in this Section, the Lead Overseer shall have the following  powers in respect of the critical ICT third-party service providers: 

    1. to request all relevant information and documentation in accordance with Article 37; 

    2. to conduct general investigations and inspections in accordance with Articles 38 and 39, respectively; 

    3. to request, after the completion of the oversight activities, reports specifying the actions that have been taken or the  remedies that have been implemented by the critical ICT third-party service providers in relation to the  recommendations referred to in point (d) of this paragraph; 

    4. to issue recommendations on the areas referred to in Article 33(3), in particular concerning the following: 

    9. the use of specific ICT security and quality requirements or processes, in particular in relation to the roll-out of  patches, updates, encryption and other security measures which the Lead Overseer deems relevant for ensuring  the ICT security of services provided to financial entities; 

        2. the use of conditions and terms, including their technical implementation, under which the critical ICT third-party  service providers provide ICT services to financial entities, which the Lead Overseer deems relevant for preventing  the generation of single points of failure, the amplification thereof, or for minimising the possible systemic impact  across the Union’s financial sector in the event of ICT concentration risk; 

        3. any planned subcontracting, where the Lead Overseer deems that further subcontracting, including subcontracting  arrangements which the critical ICT third-party service providers plan to enter into with ICT third-party service  providers or with ICT subcontractors established in a third country, may trigger risks for the provision of services  by the financial entity, or risks to the financial stability, based on the examination of the information gathered in  accordance with Articles 37 and 38; 

        4. refraining from entering into a further subcontracting arrangement, where the following cumulative conditions  are met: 

— the envisaged subcontractor is an ICT third-party service provider or an ICT subcontractor established in a  third country; 

— the subcontracting concerns critical or important functions of the financial entity; and 


— the Lead Overseer deems that the use of such subcontracting poses a clear and serious risk to the financial  stability of the Union or to financial entities, including to the ability of financial entities to comply with  supervisory requirements. 

For the purpose of point (iv) of this point, ICT third-party service providers shall, using the template referred to in  Article 41(1), point (b), transmit the information regarding subcontracting to the Lead Overseer. 

2. When exercising the powers referred to in this Article, the Lead Overseer shall: 

    1. ensure regular coordination within the JON, and in particular shall seek consistent approaches, as appropriate, with  regard to the oversight of critical ICT third-party service providers; 

    2. take due account of the framework established by Directive (EU) 2022/2555 and, where necessary, consult the relevant  competent authorities designated or established in accordance with that Directive, in order to avoid duplication of  technical and organisational measures that might apply to critical ICT third-party service providers pursuant to that  Directive; 

    3. seek to minimise, to the extent possible, the risk of disruption to services provided by critical ICT third-party service  providers to customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation. 

3. The Lead Overseer shall consult the Oversight Forum before exercising the powers referred to in paragraph 1\. 

Before issuing recommendations in accordance with paragraph 1, point (d), the Lead Overseer shall give the opportunity to  the ICT third-party service provider to provide, within 30 calendar days, relevant information evidencing the expected  impact on customers that are entities falling outside the scope of this Regulation and, where appropriate, formulating  solutions to mitigate risks. 

4. The Lead Overseer shall inform the JON of the outcome of the exercise of the powers referred to in paragraph 1,  points (a) and (b).

5. Critical ICT third-party service providers shall cooperate in good faith with the Lead Overseer, and assist it in the  fulfilment of its tasks. 

6. In the event of whole or partial non-compliance with the measures required to be taken pursuant to the exercise of  the powers under paragraph 1, points (a), (b) and (c), and after the expiry of a period of at least 30 calendar days from the  date on which the critical ICT third-party service provider received notification of the respective measures, the Lead  Overseer shall adopt a decision imposing a periodic penalty payment to compel the critical ICT third-party service  provider to comply with those measures. 

7. The periodic penalty payment referred to in paragraph 6 shall be imposed on a daily basis until compliance is  achieved and for no more than a period of six months following the notification of the decision to impose a periodic  penalty payment to the critical ICT third-party service provider. 

8. The amount of the periodic penalty payment, calculated from the date stipulated in the decision imposing the  periodic penalty payment, shall be up to 1 % of the average daily worldwide turnover of the critical ICT third-party service  provider in the preceding business year. When determining the amount of the penalty payment, the Lead Overseer shall  take into account the following criteria regarding non-compliance with the measures referred to in paragraph 6: 

    1. the gravity and the duration of non-compliance; 

    2. whether non-compliance has been committed intentionally or negligently; 

    3. the level of cooperation of the ICT third-party service provider with the Lead Overseer. 


For the purposes of the first subparagraph, in order to ensure a consistent approach, the Lead Overseer shall engage in  consultation within the JON. 

9. Penalty payments shall be of an administrative nature and shall be enforceable. Enforcement shall be governed by the  rules of civil procedure in force in the Member State on the territory of which inspections and access shall be carried out.  Courts of the Member State concerned shall have jurisdiction over complaints related to irregular conduct of enforcement.  The amounts of the penalty payments shall be allocated to the general budget of the European Union. 

10. The Lead Overseer shall disclose to the public every periodic penalty payment that has been imposed, unless such  disclosure would seriously jeopardise the financial markets or cause disproportionate damage to the parties involved. 

11. Before imposing a periodic penalty payment under paragraph 6, the Lead Overseer shall give the representatives of  the critical ICT third-party service provider subject to the proceedings the opportunity to be heard on the findings and  shall base its decisions only on findings on which the critical ICT third-party service provider subject to the proceedings  has had an opportunity to comment. 

The rights of the defence of the persons subject to the proceedings shall be fully respected in the proceedings. The critical  ICT third-party service provider subject to the proceedings shall be entitled to have access to the file, subject to the  legitimate interest of other persons in the protection of their business secrets. The right of access to the file shall not extend  to confidential information or to the Lead Overseer’s internal preparatory documents.

    3. the criteria for determining the composition of the joint examination team ensuring a balanced participation of staff  members from the ESAs and from the relevant competent authorities, their designation, tasks, and working  arrangements. 

    4. the details of the competent authorities’ assessment of the measures taken by critical ICT third-party service providers  based on the recommendations of the Lead Overseer pursuant to Article 42(3). 

2. The ESAs shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 17 July 2024\. 

Power is delegated to the Commission to supplement this Regulation by adopting the regulatory technical standards  referred to in paragraph 1 in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of Regulations (EU)  No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1094/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010. 


**Follow-up by competent authorities** 

1. Within 60 calendar days of the receipt of the recommendations issued by the Lead Overseer pursuant to Article  35(1), point (d), critical ICT third-party service providers shall either notify the Lead Overseer of their intention to follow  the recommendations or provide a reasoned explanation for not following such recommendations. The Lead Overseer  shall immediately transmit this information to the competent authorities of the financial entities concerned. 

2. The Lead Overseer shall publicly disclose where a critical ICT third-party service provider fails to notify the Lead  Overseer in accordance with paragraph 1 or where the explanation provided by the critical ICT third-party service  provider is not deemed sufficient. The information published shall disclose the identity of the critical ICT third-party  service provider as well as information on the type and nature of the non-compliance. Such information shall be limited to  what is relevant and proportionate for the purpose of ensuring public awareness, unless such publication would cause  disproportionate damage to the parties involved or could seriously jeopardise the orderly functioning and integrity of  financial markets or the stability of the whole or part of the financial system of the Union. 

The Lead Overseer shall notify the ICT third-party service provider of that public disclosure. 

3. Competent authorities shall inform the relevant financial entities of the risks identified in the recommendations  addressed to critical ICT third-party service providers in accordance with Article 35(1), point (d). 

When managing ICT third-party risk, financial entities shall take into account the risks referred to in the first subparagraph. 

4. Where a competent authority deems that a financial entity fails to take into account or to sufficiently address within  its management of ICT third-party risk the specific risks identified in the recommendations, it shall notify the financial  entity of the possibility of a decision being taken, within 60 calendar days of the receipt of such notification, pursuant to  paragraph 6, in the absence of appropriate contractual arrangements aiming to address such risks. 

5. Upon receiving the reports referred to in Article 35(1), point (c), and prior to taking a decision as referred to in  paragraph 6 of this Article, competent authorities may, on a voluntary basis, consult the competent authorities designated  or established in accordance with Directive (EU) 2022/2555 responsible for the supervision of an essential or important  entity subject to that Directive, which has been designated as a critical ICT third-party service provider. 

6. Competent authorities may, as a measure of last resort, following the notification and, if appropriate, the consultation  as set out in paragraph 4 and 5 of this Article, in accordance with Article 50, take a decision requiring financial entities to  temporarily suspend, either in part or completely, the use or deployment of a service provided by the critical ICT third-party  service provider until the risks identified in the recommendations addressed to critical ICT third-party service providers  have been addressed. Where necessary, they may require financial entities to terminate, in part or completely, the relevant  contractual arrangements concluded with the critical ICT third-party service providers. 

7. Where a critical ICT third-party service provider refuses to endorse recommendations, based on a divergent approach  from the one advised by the Lead Overseer, and such a divergent approach may adversely impact a large number of  financial entities, or a significant part of the financial sector, and individual warnings issued by competent authorities have  not resulted in consistent approaches mitigating the potential risk to financial stability, the Lead Overseer may, after  consulting the Oversight Forum, issue non-binding and non-public opinions to competent authorities, in order to  promote consistent and convergent supervisory follow-up measures, as appropriate. 

8. Upon receiving the reports referred to in Article 35(1), point (c), competent authorities, when taking a decision as  referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article, shall take into account the type and magnitude of risk that is not addressed by  the critical ICT third-party service provider, as well as the seriousness of the non-compliance, having regard to the  following criteria: 


    1. the gravity and the duration of the non-compliance; 

    2. whether the non-compliance has revealed serious weaknesses in the critical ICT third-party service provider’s  procedures, management systems, risk management and internal controls; 

    3. whether a financial crime was facilitated, occasioned or is otherwise attributable to the non-compliance; (d) whether the non-compliance has been intentional or negligent; 

    5. whether the suspension or termination of the contractual arrangements introduces a risk for continuity of the financial  entity’s business operations notwithstanding the financial entity’s efforts to avoid disruption in the provision of its  services; 

    6. where applicable, the opinion of the competent authorities designated or established in accordance with Directive (EU)  2022/2555 responsible for the supervision of an essential or important entity subject to that Directive, which has been  designated as a critical ICT third-party service provider, requested on a voluntary basis in accordance with paragraph 5  of this Article. 

Competent authorities shall grant financial entities the necessary period of time to enable them to adjust the contractual  arrangements with critical ICT third-party service providers in order to avoid detrimental effects on their digital  operational resilience and to allow them to deploy exit strategies and transition plans as referred to in Article 28\. 

9. The decision referred to in paragraph 6 of this Article shall be notified to the members of the Oversight Forum  referred to in Article 32(4), points (a), (b) and (c), and to the JON. 

The critical ICT third-party service providers affected by the decisions provided for in paragraph 6 shall fully cooperate with  the financial entities impacted, in particular in the context of the process of suspension or termination of their contractual  arrangements. 

10. Competent authorities shall regularly inform the Lead Overseer on the approaches and measures taken in their  supervisory tasks in relation to financial entities as well as on the contractual arrangements concluded by financial entities  where critical ICT third-party service providers have not endorsed in part or entirely recommendations addressed to them  by the Lead Overseer. 

11. The Lead Overseer may, upon request, provide further clarifications on the recommendations issued to guide the  competent authorities on the follow-up measures. 

<Article number="43" />

#### Oversight fees

1. The Lead Overseer shall, in accordance with the delegated act referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, charge critical  ICT third-party service providers fees that fully cover the Lead Overseer’s necessary expenditure in relation to the conduct  of oversight tasks pursuant to this Regulation, including the reimbursement of any costs which may be incurred as a result  of work carried out by the joint examination team referred to in Article 40, as well as the costs of advice provided by the  independent experts as referred to in Article 32(4), second subparagraph, in relation to matters falling under the remit of  direct oversight activities. 

The amount of a fee charged to a critical ICT third-party service provider shall cover all costs derived from the execution of  the duties set out in this Section and shall be proportionate to its turnover. 

2. The Commission is empowered to adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 57 to supplement this Regulation  by determining the amount of the fees and the way in which they are to be paid by 17 July 2024\. 


**International cooperation** 

1. Without prejudice to Article 36, EBA, ESMA and EIOPA may, in accordance with Article 33 of Regulations (EU)  No 1093/2010, (EU) No 1095/2010 and (EU) No 1094/2010, respectively, conclude administrative arrangements with  third-country regulatory and supervisory authorities to foster international cooperation on ICT third-party risk across  different financial sectors, in particular by developing best practices for the review of ICT risk management practices and  controls, mitigation measures and incident responses. 

2. The ESAs shall, through the Joint Committee, submit every five years a joint confidential report to the European  Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission, summarising the findings of relevant discussions held with the third  countries’ authorities referred to in paragraph 1, focusing on the evolution of ICT third-party risk and the implications for  financial stability, market integrity, investor protection and the functioning of the internal market.
