title: Acceptable Use Policy
---
## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1. Purpose**

This Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) establishes the mandatory rules for the acceptable use of \[Company Name\]'s information systems and information assets. Its core purpose is to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these critical assets, ensuring the company's digital operational resilience.  
Furthermore, this AUP is positioned not merely as a set of rules but as a proactive risk mitigation tool. It serves as a foundational document, integrating with existing internal policies such as the Information Classification Policy, Information Transfer Policy, Asset Register, Incident Handling Policy, Information Security Policy, and Security Policy for Human Resources. By clearly defining expectations for user behavior and outlining consequences, the AUP acts as a primary preventative control, significantly reducing the likelihood of human error or malicious insider activity leading to incidents. This approach moves beyond simple regulatory adherence to actively minimizing ICT risks.

### **1.2. Statement and Objectives**

This policy defines the acceptable and unacceptable use of \[Company Name\]'s information systems, networks, applications, and all associated information assets by all personnel. Its primary objective is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these assets, ensuring a secure and productive working environment. The policy aims to provide clear guidelines that empower users to act responsibly while safeguarding the organization's digital infrastructure.  
The specific objectives of this AUP include:

* Ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.  
* Mitigating risks associated with misuse, unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.  
* Promoting a culture of security awareness, responsibility, and ethical conduct among all users.  
* Defining clear expectations for user behavior to safeguard company resources and maintain operational resilience.  
* Providing a framework for consistent monitoring, enforcement, and disciplinary action in case of violations.

The emphasis on access being a "privilege, not a right," coupled with the focus on legal compliance, transforms this AUP from a simple guideline into a critical legal instrument.  
Beyond merely listing rules, this AUP aims to foster a specific organizational culture. The objective of "promoting a culture of security awareness, responsibility, and ethical conduct" is explicitly mentioned in the context of compliance.

### **1.3. Scope**

This policy applies to all individuals who access, use, or manage \[Company Name\]'s information systems and assets, including but not limited to:

* All employees (permanent, temporary, part-time).  
* Contractors, consultants, and third-party service providers.  
* Interns and volunteers.  
* Any other authorized users of \[Company Name\]'s resources.

The policy covers all information systems and information assets, regardless of their location (on-premises, remote, cloud-based) or ownership (company-issued or approved personal devices used for company business, where applicable). This comprehensive coverage ensures that security standards are consistently applied across the entire digital footprint of the organization. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Hardware (e.g., laptops, desktops, mobile devices, servers, networking equipment).
