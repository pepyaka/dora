title: Information Classification Policy
---

## 1\. Policy Statement and Objectives

### 1.1. Purpose

This policy establishes the framework for protecting \[company name\]'s information assets by defining requirements for their classification, labeling, and handling. Proper classification ensures that security measures are applied in proportion to an asset's sensitivity, value, and legal requirements, thereby safeguarding the organization's operations, reputation, and compliance.

### 1.2. Objectives

The primary objectives of this policy are:

* Establish a Classification Scheme: To maintain a clear, consistent information classification scheme based on confidentiality, integrity, availability, legal obligations, and business value.  
* Assign Ownership: To ensure all significant information assets are identified, assigned an appropriate classification, and have a designated owner responsible for their lifecycle.  
* Define Handling Requirements: To specify mandatory handling requirements (storage, access, transmission, disposal) for each classification level, preventing unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction.  
* Integrate with Risk Management: To formally embed the information classification process into the company's ICT risk assessment methodology.  
* Ensure Compliance: To demonstrate compliance with all applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations for information protection.  
* Promote Awareness: To foster a culture of security by ensuring all personnel understand their responsibilities through targeted training.

## 2\. Scope and Applicability

### 2.1. Information Assets Covered

This policy applies to all information assets created, received, processed, stored, or transmitted by or on behalf of \[company name\]. It encompasses all formats (digital, physical, spoken) and locations (internal networks, cloud services, company devices, partner sites), particularly those supporting documented business functions.

### 2.2. Personnel

This policy is binding for all individuals with access to \[company name\]'s information assets, including:

* Full-time and part-time employees.  
* Contractors, consultants, and temporary staff.  
* Any other party granted access to company information systems or data.

### 2.3. Third Parties

While third parties are not directly bound by this policy, contractual agreements must impose information handling obligations consistent with these requirements. \[company name\] remains accountable for the protection of its information when handled by third parties.

### 2.4. Exclusions

Information officially approved for public release is classified as 'Public' and is excluded from restrictive handling requirements post-publication. Any other exclusion requires a formal, risk-based justification and documented approval from the designated Policy Owner.

## 3\. Information Classification

### 3.1. Classification Levels

A four-tier classification scheme is adopted to categorize information based on its sensitivity and the potential impact of a compromise.

Restricted (Level 4)
: The highest classification for information of utmost sensitivity. Unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss could result in severe consequences, including major financial loss, critical operational disruption, extensive reputational damage, or serious legal violations. This level demands the most stringent security controls.  
  *Examples*: Strategic corporate plans, critical system credentials, sensitive combinations of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), regulatory investigation data, primary cryptographic keys.  

Confidential (Level 3)
: Applies to sensitive information intended for internal access on a need-to-know basis. Unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss could cause significant financial, operational, or reputational harm.  
  *Examples*: Non-public financial results, internal audit reports, detailed customer accounts, employee PII, sensitive vendor contracts.  

Internal (Level 2)
: Covers information for general use by personnel but not authorized for public disclosure. Unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss could cause moderate operational disruption or minor financial or reputational harm.  
  *Examples*: Internal policies and procedures, general employee communications, non-sensitive operational data, internal project documentation.  

Public (Level 1)
: Information explicitly approved for public release. While confidentiality is not a concern, controls are required to protect its integrity and availability.  
  *Examples*: Marketing materials, website content, published annual reports, press releases.

### 3.2. Classification Criteria

The classification level must be assigned based on an assessment of the potential impact of a security breach across the following criteria:

* *Confidentiality*: Potential harm from unauthorized disclosure.  
* *Integrity*: Potential harm from unauthorized modification or destruction.  
* *Availability*: Potential harm from the loss of timely and reliable access.  
* *Legal, Regulatory, and Contractual Requirements*: Obligations imposed by laws, regulations, or contracts.  
* *Business Value and Criticality*: The strategic, operational, or financial importance of the information.

The final classification assigned to an information asset must correspond to the highest level of risk identified across any of these criteria (the 'high-water mark' principle).

### 3.3. Mapping to Critical Functions

The classification framework directly supports the identification and protection of critical or important functions (CIFs).

1. Information assets supporting CIFs must be identified in the information asset inventory.  
2. The classification assessment for these assets must prioritize the Availability and Integrity impact criteria.  
3. The resulting classification serves as a direct input into the ICT risk assessment process, ensuring security controls and resilience measures are prioritized for assets underpinning the company's most critical operations.

### 3.4. Classification Levels and Criteria Summary

| Level | Description | Confidentiality Impact | Integrity Impact | Availability Impact | Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Restricted | Highest sensitivity; severe impact if compromised. | High | High | High | Strategic plans, cryptographic keys, critical credentials. |
| Confidential | Sensitive; significant impact if compromised. | Medium-High | Medium-High | Medium-High | Customer accounts, employee PII, internal audits. |
| Internal | For internal use; moderate impact if compromised. | Low-Medium | Low-Medium | Low-Medium | Internal policies, project docs, operational data. |
| Public | Approved for public release; minimal impact. | Minimal | Low | Low | Press releases, marketing materials, website content. |
