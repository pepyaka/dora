### **DORA-Based Company Lifecycle Stages**

#### **1. Foundational Stage (Startup / Early Stage)**

* **Deployment Frequency:** Monthly or ad hoc. Releases are large and risky.
* **Lead Time for Changes:** Weeks to months. Heavy reliance on manual processes.
* **Change Failure Rate:** High. Little automated testing; changes often break functionality.
* **Time to Restore Service:** Days. Reactive incident response; lack of monitoring.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Code deployments are stressful.
  * Minimal CI/CD setup, if any.
  * Engineers spend more time on manual debugging.
  * Focus is on product-market fit, not operational excellence.

#### **2. Growth Stage (Scaling Teams & Product)**

* **Deployment Frequency:** Weekly to biweekly.
* **Lead Time for Changes:** Days to a week.
* **Change Failure Rate:** Moderate. Some automation introduced.
* **Time to Restore Service:** Hours to a day.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Basic CI/CD pipelines begin to emerge.
  * On-call rotations and incident postmortems are introduced.
  * Monitoring and observability tools are piloted.
  * Focus begins to shift toward scalability and team velocity.

#### **3. Optimization Stage (Mid-sized / Mature Tech Org)**

* **Deployment Frequency:** Daily to multiple times per day.
* **Lead Time for Changes:** Hours to days.
* **Change Failure Rate:** Low and stable, due to improved test coverage and automation.
* **Time to Restore Service:** less than 1 hour.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Full CI/CD with automated testing and canary releases.
  * Incident response playbooks and SLOs are established.
  * Developer productivity tooling and platform engineering teams appear.
  * Focus is on reducing friction and optimizing delivery.

#### **4. High Performance Stage (Elite DevOps Organization)**

* **Deployment Frequency:** On-demand (multiple times per day or per commit).
* **Lead Time for Changes:** Less than one hour.
* **Change Failure Rate:** less than 15% or consistently improving.
* **Time to Restore Service:** Minutes.
* **Characteristics:**

  * Mature DevOps culture and SRE practices embedded.
  * Continuous improvement through DORA metrics and feedback loops.
  * Blameless retrospectives and resilience engineering.
  * Focus is on business agility, reliability, and speed at scale.

### **Using the Lifecycle**

Organizations can use this lifecycle model to:

* **Benchmark current capabilities.**
* **Set goals for improvement across DORA metrics.**
* **Identify key investments (e.g., CI/CD tooling, observability, DevOps culture).**
* **Encourage cultural shifts toward autonomy, ownership, and reliability.**
